> **!! Warning:** This plugin should not replace a password manager or peer reviewed cryptography tools for high-priority use. Do not store mission critical type data with this plugin - I cannot be sure that the info is not cached by DokuWiki or the web browser.

## Usage

```
Hi world.  I have a secret.  Can you read it?
<SECRET>I like ice cream</SECRET>
```

When the user hits 'Save' (or a draft is attempted to be saved) a prompt will open, asking the user to enter a pass phrase key for the encryption. Once supplied, the encryption will be done in the browser and the encrypted text submitted to the server.

## Settings

This plugin includes configuration settings.

* `copytoclipboard` - If set to true, the plugin tries to copy the decrypted value to the clipboard.
* `hidepasswordoncopytoclipboard` - If set to true, the decrypted value will not be shown after being copied to the clipboard (see option 'copytoclipboard').
